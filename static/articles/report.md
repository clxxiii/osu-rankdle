title: Report Button
version: v0.4.0

**The Long requested report button has been added!**

You can now report a video after you take a guess at it.

I'm made aware of every report that comes in, and if a video gets a lot of reports, I will remove it from the rotation.

## Some other changes I made

- Form auto-fill-in and displayed rank now always use osu!standard rank
- More rank exposure issues fixed

Development on this is gonna slow down as I start getting into classes, but I still have a whole lot of ideas for where to go next, so stay tuned.

As always, thanks so much for the support, it means more than you could ever imagine.
