Firstly, thank you all so much for such a successful launch. I didn't think this would get so popular so fast!

**Let's get into the changes I made in the past three days:**

**Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed an issue where users could not log in with an account (day 1)
- Fixed an issue where the next button would still be clickable, even after getting to HP0. (day 1)
- Fixed an issue with users being able to get the answer to a map before submitting a guess (day 2)
- Fixed more login issues (day 2)
- Mobile Support (day 2)

**Added features**

- [Results page](/results) has been added, so you can view your match history!
- If your video has been added to the rotation, you can view it by heading to the [video page](/videos)
